# Introduction

The goal of this project was to create a working miniature desktop display inspired by the 'Macrodata Refinement' computers featured in Apple TV's *Severance*. This build consists of two core elements: the software and the physical enclosure, both outlined below.

# I. The Software

#### Objectives

  - Generate a randomized **number grid** with grouped 'bad numbers'.  
  - Animate and style the **interface** to match the aesthetics of the show. 

## a. The Number Grid  

![generation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba004291-8ea9-4b84-995f-f6229e6b8b41)

> **GENERATE**  
  - A *NÃ—N* grid is created.  
  - Each cell is filled with a random integer between 0-9.  

> **MAP**  
  - A Perlin noise map assigns smooth gradient values to the grid.  
  - This ensures numbers are naturally grouped rather than randomly scattered.  

> **THRESHOLD**  
  - Each cell's value is compared to a set threshold.  
  - Values above the threshold are marked as 'bad'/'scary' numbers.  

> **GROUP**  
  - 'Bad' numbers are grouped based on proximity to one another.  
  - At random intervals, a group visible in the viewport will be activated:  
    - If hovered over, they become **'super active'**, extending their active time and appearing agitated.  
    - If clicked, the group is **'refined'**, animating into a pre-determined bin and resetting as no longer 'bad'.  

## b. The Interface

</p>

- A moving Perlin noise map offsets each number (vertically or horizontally).  
- Activated bad groups expand / contract / jitter.
- Numbers scale based on cursor position.
- Refined groups animate into bins, with a percent bar keeping track of your progress.  

#### Additional Features:
- The application is cross-compatible, allowing compilation for both Linux and Raspberry Pi (ARM).
- A debug mode reveals various settings (which can be saved / loaded from disk as JSON).
- An 'idle' mode can be enabled to display the Lumon logo screensaver.
- The number grid animates on-screen when going from idle mode.
- The user can navigate the full grid using arrow and zoom keys.

# II. The Housing

#### Objectives

  - Reconstruct the computer housing from the show as a printable 3D model.
  - Design the interior to support a RaspberryPi + screen
